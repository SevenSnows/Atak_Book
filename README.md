# Atak_Book
A guide to getting ATAK up and running easily 

## What this is
A guide that aims to make it possible - in less time - to get a ATAK system up and running. 

Rather than wade through the documentation for multiple different systems which need to be integrated to get the best out of ATAK; and to be honest the trial and error that results in; we try and give one guide which gets you operational. And provide the links to the great software that others have written. 

In the end we'll try have an online and offline install guide - i.e. One uses the Google Play Store a lot; whereas the other is working on the basis of installation from saved files. 

All Errors are mine only. 

# Prerequisites
## A Phone .... or two
- Samsung Phone - recommend S20+
  - On a Huawei 2019 Voice plugin crashes the ATAK app - though we got most other working.
    - Not that we recommend Huawei....

You really want two phones - as you need to be able to communicate between different 'users' and hence see the inter-op features. Once you can do two phones, three + is easy.
